Usage:
  v [flags] fmt path_to_source.v [path_to_other_source.v]

Formats the given V source files, then prints their formatted source to stdout.

Options:
  -c    Check if file is already formatted.
        If it is not, print filepath, and exit with code 2.
  -diff Display only diffs between the formatted source and the original source.
  -l    List files whose formatting differs from vfmt.
  -w    Write result to (source) file(s) instead of to stdout.
 -debug Print the kinds of encountered AST statements/expressions on stderr.

NB: vfmt after 2020/04/01 is based on the new AST compiler code, and
thus is much faster, and more flexible than before.
It may also EAT some of your code for now, so please be careful, and
make frequent BACKUPS.
